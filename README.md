McMakler - Front-end


I used the NPM and Gruntjs to compile and minify the css, js files and optimize the images.
In the Gruntjs I config some tasks as jshint, uglify, sass - compiler, autoprefixer, cssmin and imagemin to better job.
In the index.html is only static html file.
The index-api.html is the loading data from api.
